# NotebookLM — Custom AI Notebooks

**Turn real sources into clear, grounded, usable systems.**

This repository contains the source code for a single-page site showcasing **custom NotebookLM builds** — purpose-built AI notebooks designed to turn PDFs, links, notes, and research into one coherent system you can actually use.

No fluff. No generic chatbots. No hallucinated answers.

## What This Is

This project is a **live showroom** for the kinds of AI notebooks I build using **NotebookLM** and a multimodal research workflow.

Each notebook is designed around one core question:

> **“What do you actually need clarity on?”**

Instead of dumping sources into folders, these builds:
- Architect the notebook structure
- Wire in high-leverage prompts
- Preserve nuance and citations
- Produce systems that hold up over time

The HTML in this repo renders a complete landing page that explains the concept, shows example builds, and allows people to request a custom notebook.

## Example Notebook Domains

The site highlights example builds across multiple domains, including:

- Philosophy & meaning  
- Medicine & clinical prep  
- Trauma & recovery  
- Performance & neuroplasticity  
- Sustainability & infrastructure  
- Industry research & strategy  
- Work, purpose, and decision-making  

Different topics — same outcome:  
**clarity from real sources, not AI noise.**

## Tech Stack

- **Pure HTML + CSS**
- No frameworks
- No JavaScript dependencies
- Fully responsive
- Dark-mode native
- Designed for fast iteration and easy hosting (GitHub Pages–ready)

This is intentional: the value is in the *thinking and structure*, not the stack.
